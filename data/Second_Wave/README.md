# Second Wave Survey Data

This data was collected through two means:
  * A YouGov survey (see ....)
  * A Qualtrics survey aimed at URI and other college students across RI

We made several pulls of this data, so similarly named files are just different
pulls of the same data set. They are each labeled by the day they were pulled.

N.B. It _should_ be the case that each successive file from each survey taker
is a superset of the previous file. However, we save all of them as we did make
some preliminary presentations and so we want to be able to reproduce those.

## YouGov Data

The YouGov data is labeled as `YouGov_YYYY-MM-DD.sav`. The Qualtrics data is labeled as `Qualtrics_YYYY-MM-DD.sav`.
