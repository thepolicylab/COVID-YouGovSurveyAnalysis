Invoking the good of the community is common guidance for promoting public
health behaviors. Korn and colleagues (1) suggest emphasizing the collective
nature of vaccination to promote uptake after finding that people treat
vaccination like a social contract transcending in-group/out-group dynamics.
Similar recommendations appear in Covid-19 policy briefs (2, 3) and popular
press articles (4). If appeals beyond narrow self-interest can increase
willingness to vaccinate, lives will be saved since intent-to-vaccinate levels
hover below that required for herd immunity. And the rationale for this
strategy is clear: public health emergencies require collective effort, so
motivating individual contributions with community appeals is intuitive and
rhetorically uncontroversial.

Unfortunately, we have found no direct evidence that collective-good
appeals work for vaccinations and considerable related evidence
suggesting it should not. Covid-19 behavioral studies show no effect of
such appeals on intended social distancing (5, 6, 7) or self-reported
staying at home (8), a small effect on intended mask-wearing that
vanished with demographic controls (5), and a reverse effect---self and
family appeals faring better than community appeals---for intended
staying at home (8) and real information seeking (choosing to read CDC
guidelines; 9). Only one experiment in one paper (7) showed an
unqualified increase in intended preventive behaviors. An earlier,
hypothetical vaccination experiment (10) also showed no main effect of
collective framing.

As part of The Policy Lab's regular surveys on Covid beliefs and
attitudes, we tested community versus family-based appeals for
vaccination in a randomized survey experiment (500 Rhode Island
residents, YouGov, code/data:
https://github.com/thepolicylab/COVID-YouGovSurveyAnalysis) conducted
after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine received emergency authorization
(12/11--23/20). We measured vaccination interest by offering people the
option to read their state's vaccination plan and hence learn "which
groups are likely to receive the coronavirus vaccine first." A statement
preceding the option read "Getting vaccinated against the coronavirus is
important for the health and wellbeing of your \[family/community\]." We
reasoned that taking time for additional reading after a long survey
indicated vaccination interest with minimal social desirability bias.
Respondents who clicked the link saw a real infographic issued by the
department of health.

Most people (75%) did not read the plan. But consistent with (9), more
who did were in the family (29%) than the community condition (22%;
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, $\chi^2$ = 3.7, *p* = .06). The result remains
for the subset of greatest concern, those who did not report definite
intentions to vaccinate (*n* = 273; 26% vs. 13%, $\chi^2$ = 7.5, *p* =
.009). Neither baseline vaccine intention (1-5 scale: *M*~Family~ =
3.45, *M*~Community~ = 3.66, *t*\[498\] = -1.6, *p* = .109) nor any
other demographic variable (overall balance test with 26 terms, *p* =
.3) differed by experimental condition.

The balance of evidence suggests, counterintuitively, that common-good
appeals have limited utility. Although our data cannot show whether they
are better than no message at all, we caution against relying on them to
encourage high-cost behaviors like vaccination. Health message
interventions may be most successful by appealing to the wellbeing of
people's families.
