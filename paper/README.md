To make the pdf document from the markdown document do:

```
pandoc -t pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex No_evidence_that_collective_good_appeals_best_promote_Covid_related_health_behaviors.md -o No_evidence_that_collective_good_appeals_best_promote_Covid_related_health_behaviors.pdf
```

If you want to use a graphic user interface, you can try [panwriter](https://panwriter.com/) or [panwriter github repo](https://github.com/mb21/panwriter) although we have not tested it.
